### Known Issues

For this tool to work correctly, you must allow pop-ups from the website. Modern browsers block pop-ups by default as a security measure.
Follow these steps to enable pop-ups:

    📥 Submit your details. Your browser will block the pop-ups and show an icon in the address bar.
    🖱️ Click the icon. It usually looks like a window with a red 'X'.
    ✅ Choose "Always allow pop-ups..." from the dialog that appears.
    💾 Click "Done" to save your choice.
    🔁 Run the tool again. It should now work perfectly!
