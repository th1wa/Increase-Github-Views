### Known Issues

For this tool to work correctly, you must allow pop-ups from the website. Modern browsers block pop-ups by default as a security measure.
Follow these steps to enable pop-ups:

  1. After entering your details and clicking "Submit," your browser will likely block the pop-ups.
  2. Look for a "Pop-ups blocked" icon in your browser's address bar (usually on the right side).
  3. Click on this icon. A dialog box will appear.
  4. In the dialog, select the option that says "Always allow pop-ups and redirects from [website name]".
  5. Click the "Done" button.
  6. Run the script again, and it will now work as intended.
